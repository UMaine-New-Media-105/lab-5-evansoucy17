Exercise 1 

https://editor.p5js.org/evansoucy17/sketches/SRQzFIeia

For this I created a line of code that takes an avatar I created and moves it around the canvas randomly and bounces off the walls once it hits it. 
This was extrmely hard to achomplish. It took awhile to understand how to randomize the speed as well as the location. I added a few to many lines of 
code that were unnecessary muddling up the code. But after some problem solving and help I was able to figure it out. Once the sprite was moving around 
at random intervals and directions it was a matter of tweaking my inequalities to make the sprite better bounce off the walls. 

Exercise 2

For this code I copied the code I created for exercise 1. I then added the keyPressed funciton swapping out the value for the speed inequalities used in
the previous code. Once I did that I clicked the play button and when the right, left, up and down arrow are pressed the sprite moves in response to the 
command.
